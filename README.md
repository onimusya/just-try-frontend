Welcome to your new `Just Try Demo App` project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `Just Try Demo App`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/motoko-dfinity/motoko/)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.icp0.io)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd our_tool/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

### Step 1: Build and deploy the frontend canister
```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface for FRONTEND
dfx deploy just-try-frontend
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.


### Step 2: Build and deploy the backend canister:

```bash
dfx canister create just-try-backend
dfx build just-try-backend
dfx canister install just-try-backend --argument='(principal "2mxjj-pyyts-rk2hl-2xyka-avylz-dfama-pqui5-pwrhx-wtq2x-xl5lj-qqe")'
dfx deploy just-try-backend
```


## Authorization

To authorize an identity to upload files, it must be authorized first:

```bash
dfx canister call just-try-frontend authorize '(principal "<Your Internet Identity Principal Id>")'
```


### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
